# Drools SpreadSheet
The project demonstrates the use of Drools rule engine to extract the business rules into a separate spread sheet. 

## Why should we use a rule engine?
Rule engine helps us in manging our business conditions into a more organised why.
It helps us in cases where we need to regularly update our rules still without altering any other functionality.

## When not to use rule engines?
If your rules are a bunch of if..else.. then you will not be able to fully utilize the benefits of rule engines. 

## Why Drools?
Drools is an open source, widely used and maintained rule engine. It has good integration with many popular frameworks.

## Which one is better, Drl or xls?
Drools allow us to use drl which has its own dsl to write rules. 
However with xls support we can create rules in excel spreadsheets which are widely understood by both technical and business users.
